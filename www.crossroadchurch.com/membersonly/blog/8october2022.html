  <h1>8 October 2022</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px">I just had a very insightful talk. And I realised many things. Maybe I should continue talking to others. I'm starting to grow, and maybe for the better.<br><br>PS: Jason's a son of a bitch. That's it. I hate him, and I regret it. I'm so dependant over him, but no longer. I'll learn to depend on myself.</p>
