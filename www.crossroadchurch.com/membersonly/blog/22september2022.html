  <h1>22 September 2022</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px">I want to scream. I don't know what I want to do. I just... can't do anything right now. Maybe I should chat with someone. I don't know. I hope I'm ready... I managed to get some of my work done though, so that's good. Work has been tough, and with this shitty relationship, I don't know how much more I can take. I'll just... go back and do some more work. Drowning in work is better than facing my feelings, I guess.</p>
