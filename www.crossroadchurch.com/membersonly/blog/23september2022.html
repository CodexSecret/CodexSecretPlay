  <h1>23 September 2022</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px">So. I made a good first step today. I texted Diana Sauter. I think she helped. I talked to Diana about that son of a bitch. I showed her my messages, and explained my entire thing. She was... honestly not what I expected. I thought they would judge me for having bad taste, but she was actually really kind! She referred me to... someone else, which reminds me of Montague, haha Shakespeare. Sorry, literature major. Hopefully, I can get over this entire problem. I would love to get back to a normal life without crying and depressing sad bedtime thoughts.</p>
