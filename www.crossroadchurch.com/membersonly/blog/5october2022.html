  <h1>5 October 2022</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px">I think I'm ready. I might talk to the person Diana talked about. It might be better if I do. Hopefully, she could show me the best possible way to continue on this painful journey. I just want the pain to end... Will it ever end? Love hurts, maybe I should just... give up.</p>
