  <h1>20 September 2022</h1>
  <p style="font-size:20px">It seems like whatever I upload here requires a password. Something about being safer in terms of privacy. They said that I am allowed to encode the password however I like, they're apparently experienced in puzzle cracking. Something about solving ARGs? I don't know. I might encode the passwords if they're more sensitive. But anyways, they also said that all usernames for files and chats are ADMIN.</p>
