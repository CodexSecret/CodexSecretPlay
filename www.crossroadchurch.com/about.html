          <li>Help you to grow mature. We want you to grow, and learn the way to understand and deal with life. We will be there for you, but we want you to grow and learn to make the right decisions under her eyes.</li>
          <li>Connect you to people with similar experiences, and for them to be able to learn from you, or for you to learn from them.</li>
          <li>Share your experiences with others, and to teach others on your victory against those problems you had. Everyone will be able to learn from them.</li>
          <li>Help you through the temptations, and teach you to resist them. Temptations are a part of life that we cannot remove, and we'd like to help you to curb those temptations.</li>
